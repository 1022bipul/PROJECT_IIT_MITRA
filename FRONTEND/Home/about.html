            <p>
             Traditional social platforms often fall short of the unique needs of IITians. They’re noisy, cluttered, and lack academic focus—not to mention the absence of user verification. IIT Mitra fills this gap by creating an ecosystem that supports:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>Professional networking with verified peers and alumni</li>
            <li>Mentorship and community support for newcomers to feel at home and flourish</li>
            <li>Trusted communication with verified users only—no bots, no noise</li>
            </ul>
            Whether you're navigating your first semester, building a startup, or looking to give back as an alumnus, IIT Mitra is your companion for every step of the journey.
